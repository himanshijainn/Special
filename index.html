                <p>So love, as I said, I'm not very good at many things so I decided to try another way, so here I
                    am trying to create a letter/website for you, I don't know if it was such a cool idea but it was
                    from the heart.</p>
            </aside>

            <h1>How it all began</h1>

            <p>Our love story begins on a day I'd rather forget, a day that seemed to be the worst for me. But on that
                very day, I met you. Time has flown by since then, yet I still vividly remember our first hug, our first
                kiss, and the first touch of our hands. These moments are etched into my heart; they're something I
                can't change. And most of all, I can never forget the first look you gave me. </p>

            <p>It's been exactly 480 days since it all started (still counting), during that
                time so much has happened to both of us, and I can say that it was one of the best and is being one of
                the best moments of my life and if I wish I want it to last forever. I am very grateful to God that you
                came into my life.</p>

            <h2>Our moments</h2>

            <div class="fotos">
                <picture>
                    <source media="(max-width: 670px)" srcset="">
                    <img src="img/1.jpeg" alt="Foto nossa no palácio">
                </picture>
            </div>

            <p>Each and every moment we share is as beautiful as we are, adorned with not just laughter and joy, but
                also with the occasional fights and arguments. Through it all, you remain steadfast by my side, whether
                in my darkest hours or amidst the most beautiful of times. Your presence is a constant source of comfort
                and strength, a reminder that love endures through every challenge and triumph.</p>

            <h2>The big day</h2>

            <div class="fotos">
                <picture>
                    <source media="(max-width: 670px)" srcset="">
                    <img src="img/2.jpeg" alt="Pedido de namoro">
                </picture>
            </div>

            <p>On 06/10/2022 I asked you to be my boyfriend, I don't even know how to explain that day, I just know
                that I want to live my life with you, and that the center of our relationship will always be God.</p>

            <h2>Our phrase</h2>

            <p>Of course I couldn't forget our phrase, <strong><em><q>we'll get it together</q></em></strong> I hope
                that regardless of the situation that happens to us, we'll trust in God and face it together as a couple
                and as the phrase says , <strong><em><q>we'll get it together</q></em></strong>, everything is a
                process.</p>

            <aside class="segundo">
                <h3>May our love reflect the teachings of Ahinsa, Karuna, and Prema</h3>

                <blockquote>Love is depicted as patient, kind, and free from negative emotions such as jealousy, pride,
                    and anger. It promotes respect, forgiveness, and a celebration of goodness while enduring challenges
                    with faith, hope, and patience. It serves as a heartfelt commitment to continue building a
                    meaningful relationship, acknowledging the importance of God's guidance in the journey ahead.
                </blockquote>

                <p>So love of my life, let's continue building our story together, if God allows it.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>Love, this is a brief summary of our story until 01/03/2024, which is the day I'm writing, if I were to
                put everything that has already happened, I don't know if the site would handle it hahaha, I'm joking
                but you know it's already happened a lot.</p>
